    <p>Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage. 
       According to Fresh Water Watch, water conservation is important because fresh clean water is a 
       limited resource, as well as a costly one.Conserving water is important because it keeps water pure and 
       clean while protecting the environment. Conserving water means using our water supply wisely and be 
       responsible. As every individual depends on water for livelihood, we must learn how to keep our limited 
       supply of water pure and away from pollution.</p>

    <p>Kabaddi is an Indian contact team sport[2] with origins in Tamil Nadu.[3] Played between two teams of seven 
      players, the objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into 
      the opposing team's half of a court, touch out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their 
      own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath.[4] Points are 
      scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. 
      Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point 
      scored by their team from a tag or tackle.

      It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi 
      appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. 
      It is the national sport of Bangladesh.[5] It is the state game of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, 
      Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.

    <p>Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle science, which focuses on 
      bringing harmony between mind and body. It is an art and scince of healthy living. The word ‘Yoga’ is 
      derived from the Sanskrit root ‘Yuj’, meaning ‘to join’ or ‘to yoke’ or ‘to unite’. As per Yogic scriptures 
      the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness, 
      indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man & Nature. According to modern scientists, 
      everything in the universe is just a manifestation of the same quantum firmament. One who experiences 
      this oneness of existence is said to be in yoga, and is termed as a yogi, having attained to a state of 
      freedom referred to as mukti, nirvana or moksha. Thus the aim of Yoga is Self-realization, to overcome 
      ll kinds of sufferings leading to 'the state of liberation' (Moksha) or ‘freedom’ (Kaivalya). Living with 
      freedom in all walks of life, health and harmony shall be the main objectives of Yoga practice."Yoga” also 
      refers to an inner science comprising of a variety of methods through which human beings can realize this 
      union and achieve mastery over their destiny.Yoga, being widely considered as an ‘immortal cultural outcome’ 
      of Indus Saraswati Valley civilization – dating back to 2700 B.C., has proved itself catering to both material 
      and spiritual upliftment of humanity.Basic humane values are the very identity of Yoga Sadhana.</p>
